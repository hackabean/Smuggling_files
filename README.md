# vba_macro_base64_decode method

This one relies on taking base64 encoded file as an input and macro will decode it to a file. AV solutions may detect that
as 'malicious' bahaviour so it is worth using EvilClippy and VBA stomping technique to evade the scanning engine.

Note:
Use Create_base64_macro_for_Word.sh provided script to quickly generate VBA macro code from any file.
